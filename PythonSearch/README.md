# PythonSearch Tutorial

This guide will help you create a simple Python program that searches the internet using both the Google Custom Search API and the Bing Web Search API. You can use this as a starting point for building more complex search applications or incorporating additional features.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- A basic understanding of Python programming concepts.
- Access to a computer with Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
- An internet connection to make API requests and search the web.

## Installation

1. Open your preferred text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Atom.

2. Create a new file and save it with a .py extension (e.g., "main.py").

3. Copy and paste the code from the previous message into your main script file.

## Configuration

Replace the placeholders in the following lines of code with your own API keys from Google and Bing:
```python
google_api_key = "your_google_api_key"
bing_api_key = "your_bing_api_key"
```
You can sign up for free API keys from both services by visiting their respective developer websites.

## Running the Program

To run your PythonSearch script:

1. Save your main script file (e.g., "main.py").

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your PythonSearch project.

3. Type `python main.py` (or similar, depending on your system) and press Enter.

4. The program will prompt you for a search query. Enter a keyword or phrase and press Enter.

5. The program will display the top 10 results from both Google and Bing searches.

## Adding Additional Features

You can modify this script to suit your needs by:

- Storing the search results in a text file (e.g., CSV format) for easy access later.
- Performing additional processing on the data, such as filtering or sorting.
- Incorporating other APIs or web scrapers to expand the scope of your search capabilities.
